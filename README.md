The respository contains the project files for DEVP assignments under the supervision and guidance of Prof. Amarnath Mitra. 

The nomenclature has been simplied as much as possible but for the user's reference- here are the purposes of the files:
1. DEVP Project_Group 26: Contains the project files for first project of DEVP
2. DEVP Project_055008: Contains the second and final project for DEVP.
3. Streamlit.py: Contains the files for the streamlit dashboard. The author requests the user to fork this repository and run this file locally on their system.
4. Requirements.txt: Contains the library requirements for the streamlit dashboard to work

Thank you for going through my and ChatGPT's/Gemini's work. Live long and prosper!
